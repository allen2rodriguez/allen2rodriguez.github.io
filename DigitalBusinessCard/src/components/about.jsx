                Hi, I'm a Computer Science and Business Management student at ASU with experience in data analysis, programming, and product development. 
                Iâ€™m passionate about innovation and learning.
                I bridge the gap between business and technology, and I love building intelligent user-friendly apps like my wearable tech concept TechStyle.
